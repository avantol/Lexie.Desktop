Lexie "spots" (and optionally announces) countries on the amateur radio bands around the world as they become active throughout the day. Lexie listens to WSJT-X via UDP, and has two blind-accessible options.
<br><br>- This desktop app runs with WSJT-X, multicast UDP (can't interfere with loggers, Tilly, etc.)
<br>- No installation required, download and run just one file. See "Releases".
<br>- Options for self-voicing (sound output), screen reader (like NVDA), or silence.
<br>- No configuration necessary, Lexie detects the default UDP port(s) WSJT-X uses, multicast or unicast.
<br><br>Who is Lexie? The famous world traveler (get it?) who visited every country before she was past 21 years old. Inspiring.
